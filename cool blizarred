        <h1>Half of the stages are easy enough, but the othersez
             can be extremely difficult, especially if you're underleveled. Many
        of these stages are enemy-spam. They require certain cats, a specific strategy to overcome these challenges, and
        determination. The player will also need all Anti-unstarred Alien Treasures and Bahamut Cat's True Form, as without them
        it will be nearly impossible to beat Cursed Blizzards and Sign of the Cat.</h1>
