    Fill a small pot with water and bring to a boil. While the water is boiling you can chop the ingredients. Dice the
    onion. Mince the garlic. Debone the chiken thigh and cut into 1/2in pieces. Thighs are used because they stay moist and
    dont dry out easily. But chicken breast can be used. Put frozen peas in a strainer and pour boiling water over the peas
    slowly making sure all the peas get a good bath. Now in a mediun size skillet add 1 tablespoon of oil and turn the heat
    to medium. Any oil can be used. When the oil is hot add the garlic and stir around a few seconds. Then add the onions.
    Stir until the onion become transparent. Now add the chicken. Stir until chicken becomes white and firm. Now add a
    tablespoon of rice wine. Can be substituted with any cooking wine or white wine. Stir until the wine has evaporated.
    Crumble the bouillon cube into the mixture then add the ketchup. You can add more or less ketchup depending on your
    taste. Stir for a minute to make sure everything is well blended. Add the cooked rice. Stir well making sure to break up
    any big chunks of rice. When well blended remove from heat. Scramble the 3 eggs very good. Pan size will determine the
    thickness and size of the egg "blanket". The smaller the pan the thicker and smaller the egg "blanket , the larger the
    pan the thiner and larger the egg "blanket". In a medium to large skillet add the last tablespoon of oil. Make sure the
    heat in on low to medium. You dont want your eggs to burn. If using a nonstick skillet less oil can be used. When oil is
    heated add the egg to the skillet. Swirl the eggs around the pan to coat the whole bottom of the pan with the eggs. When
    the egg is cooked all the way through remove from the heat. If the egdes of the egg hasnt started to pull away from the
    pan already very gently use a spatula to pull the edges free. You want the egg to move freely in the pan. Add the rice
    mixture down the center of the egg. Now gently bring the sides of the egg to cover the mixture. If it doesnt completely
    cover the rice mixture thats ok, as long at it covers most of the sides. Now the tricky part ! Getting it on the plate !
    Now gently push the whole thing to the edge of the pan opposite the handle. Take your plate and put it on top of the
    pan. Flip the pan over and the omurice should be on the plate seam side down. If it didnt plop out perfectly just push
    the rice back in under the egg and inconspicuously tuck the egg back around the rice. Shape into an oval while still hot.
    and add ketchup to top</p> <p> Pizza</p> <p> <img src="Screenshot 2025-06-16 172545.png" style="width:170px; height: 170px; margin: left 15px;; float: right;">Real pizza only consists of pre colonial ethnic Sicilian and Italian dough and cheese pastries. What is known as "party
    pizza" is nothing more than cultural appropriation and shameless consumerism piggybacking off of the success of the
    Italian-NewYorker immigrant sellouts intending to please gluttonous and tasteless Americans. When people say Chicago
    Deep Dish and Mexican Pizza aren't "real pizza" but say that New York Style pan pizza is, I can't help but laugh because
    New York Style is just as fake as the rest of them (plus the pretensiousness). Real pizza tastes subdued, thoughtful,
    and you can feel the love and thought put into every bite. Fake pizza is nothing but a failed tastbud-assaulting attempt
    at bringing diversity into the American fast food diet. PIZZA BELONGS TO THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION OF EUROPE, NOT TO NEW
    YORK, CHICAGO, TEXAS, SANFRANCISCO, OR ANY OTHER AMERICAN CITY.</p> <hr> <p> pizza</p>
